Time complexity
---------------
The doBracketsMatch has a time complexity of O(n).
This is because there is only one loop thus the execution 
time is linear.

Space Complexity
----------------
The doBracketsMatch fuction store values in a stack data structure
within the loop, therefore, the space complexity is directly 
propositional to the size of inputString.
